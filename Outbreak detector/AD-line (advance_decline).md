This file looks at the advance-decline line for the sp500, for other indexes it could also be checked by adjusting [sp500_tickers].

**How to use**
- If the market is still rallying while the AD line is declining it says that less stocks are participating in the rally, this could indicate that this will be the end of the rally.
- When major indexes are rallying, a rising A/D line confirms the uptrend showing strong participation.
- If major indexes are declining and the A/D line is rising, fewer stocks are declining over time, which means the index may be near the end of its decline.
-  When major indexes are declining, a falling advance/decline line confirms the downtrend.
