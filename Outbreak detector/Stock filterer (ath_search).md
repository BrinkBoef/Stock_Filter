The goal of this program is to search for specific stocks that have specific properties.
The properties that are filtered upon are based upon the views of William O'Neil and David Ryan. 

**First Filter**
First all tickers from the NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX are used and the first filter filters the stocks down to only stocks that trade near their historic all time high. Feel free to add more documents containing tickers to do a broader market search.

**Second Filter**
Here all stocks that trade below 10 or have more then 50 million shares outstanding are filtered out.

**Third Filter**
This filter is based on the relative strength index (RSI), we want to have stocks with high momentum and thus a 14 day RSI above 80. If this is not the case we filter out the stocks.

**Fourth Filter**
The last filter looks at earning beats. The stock should always have beaten earnings to not be filtered out. After this filter only about 10 stocks remain, we ourselves can look further into these stocks as they do have some interesting properties.

*What to look for after the fourth filter?*

New (N)
- The stock should have something new going on, a new product or service, new management and or a big change in industry.

Look at the trend of the RSI, is the RSI strengthening or is it weakening? (L)
- We would like to see a strengthening RSI to indicate strong momentum

Use the Volume tool, are we on the brink of a breakout and is volume increasing dramatically? (M)
- We want to see volume increase at the point of a breakout
- If at a breakout volume barely moves, be cautious!!
- We want to see volume low at times of consolidation, when volume gets back, we should expect to see a breakout

Look for institutional ownership (I)
- We want some institutional ownership, but it should not be excessive, as then their could be a lot of selling when something goes south
- With some ownership it gives stock legitimacy and room for other big whales to enter

PE ratio (C, A)
- Probably keep it on the lower side below 30 so the PE has room to run.
- Earnings should have increased YoY around 70%
- CAGR of earnings should be good, around 24%

When entered a trade based on this document
- cut losses at 7 percent
- Usually William and David leave position after 12 months

These comments are further based on the CANSLIM formula, that is kind of where the brackets are for.

**BROADER MARKET**
For the broader market the authors state that having a close look at the advance/decline line is important to spot the end off a bull market
