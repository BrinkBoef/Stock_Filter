Tool that will show volume overtime

**First Plot**
This just shows the volume over time, tweak [time_range] as a variable for how many years you want to see it.

**Second Plot**
This plot shows has the range of the past year. There are 12 segments representing an individual month. The big green line in each segment is the average volume change of the segment. The box surrounding it shows the standard deviation, the lower and upper bound. The dotted red line is average change in volume of the entire past year.

The intuition is that when volume is above its standard deviation that we can expect more price movement. If based on other indicators the price should move and we see a higher volume increase, it strengthens the argument made by the other indicator.

**Third Plot**
This limits the segment to just the last running month, this is useful to see a bit more detail.
